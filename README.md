# Siatoes custom folder icons pack
Custom Folder Icon for some programming language i've created in my free times.
## Usage
1. Download the icon you wish to use from .ICO folder ( The .png would not work! )
2. Select your folder that you wish to change the icon and click Properties > Customize
3. On folder icon, Click change icon > browse and select the .ICO that you had downloaded.
>[!NOTE]
>Make sure that you save your folder icon and do not delete it, Otherwise the folder icon would be reset back to default.
>If your custom folder icon did not show or show an incorrect image you may need to consider clearing icon cache, I suggest using [this tool](https://www.tenforums.com/attachments/>tutorials/410440d1716480069-rebuild-icon-cache-windows-10-a-rebuild_icon_cache.bat)
## Creating your own folder icons
Download Base.ai from .AI folder and edit them to your choosing, Than export them as png ( I suggest using export for web ) Than convert them to .ICO, I recommend using this [free website](https://www.icoconverter.com/)
